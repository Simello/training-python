Notes:

   - I work on linux distributions where python works natively without
     any specific installation or configuration procedure. Windows and Mac
     users should have their python installations ready for the training.
   - We will be using python 3.3/3.4 for the training and discuss
differences
     in python 2.7, unless requested otherwise in advance.
   - Using an IDE is not part of the training unless a specific one is
     requested in advance. A basic text editor suitable for programming
     and a terminal window are all that you need.
   - Altering the course to fit your needs is possible and encouraged.
